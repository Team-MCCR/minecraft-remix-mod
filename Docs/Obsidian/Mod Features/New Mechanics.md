### Crystal-based energy generation with sunlight.

- Pretty slow do charge up, but can house 9 Power Crystals/Lattices to quickly discharge energy on demand and recharge in parallel.
- Standing on solar panels during day will hurt player (like Magma Blocks)
- Strong discharges may hurt the user if they wear energizable armor.
- Copper Wires connect energy from Solar Panels.
- Copper Charge Pad - Discharges energy to standing players, goes through metal pressure plates. Activates with redstone only.
	- Leather and Diamond boots insulate players.
	- Sudden shocks of up to 2-5 crystals' worth of energy at once will hurt the player.
	- Damage goes up and lights player on fire above that, can be lethal on metal wearers.
	- Damaging shocks will polarize all Chainmail and Iron equipment, making them magnetic. A second shock will revert the effect.
		- Polar-Polar players will repel each other slightly, Polar-Apolar players will be attracted.
	- Copper and Grimalcite gear with Energy Crystals will mitigate damage taken and charge them up, granting buffs and using power instead of durability until it's empty.
