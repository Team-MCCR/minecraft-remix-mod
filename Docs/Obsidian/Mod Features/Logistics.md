## CHANGES

- Better automation for Enchantment Table and Brewing Stands slots.

## ADDITIONS

- **Item Pipes** can be made with Copper, and work as simple item transfer blocks.
	- Can be set to extract items or be disconnected from blocks with the Soldering Iron.
	- Same speed as Hoppers?
- **Safes** are made with Iron Blocks, A **Heavy Core** and a **Padlock.**
	- Padlocks are made with Netherite and a Nametag. Right-Clicking a loose Padlock opens up a GUI to set a custom 4-digit pin to the item.
	- Safes crafted inherit the Padlock Pin and requires the correct input for access each time.
	- Safes take 3x longer than Obsidian to be mined. Items aren't dropped when broken.
	- Safes are affected by gravity and are immune to explosions.
	- Double-Chest sized inventory.
	- Each digit typed on a safe plays an unique note, which allows for eavesdropping the password.
