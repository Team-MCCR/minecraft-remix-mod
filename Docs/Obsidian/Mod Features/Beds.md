## CHANGES

- Beds now scan for the environment they're in, checking for closed walls & light levels within reason.
- Either forbid the player to sleep at all if condition's aren't met, or gauge a chance they'll get the old "nightmares" (a monster spawns to wake them up) based on how unsafe the bed is.
- Better odds at being safe with doors, glass windows and other decorations. 
  (?)
- Conditions include a well lit, closed area that isn't too massive, nor too small.
